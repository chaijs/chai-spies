# Chai Spies

This is an addon plugin for the [chai](http://github.com/logicalparadox/chai) assertion library. It provides the
most basic function spy ability and tests. Though useful for small modules, you are probably going to want something
more robust. Check out [jack](http://github.com/vesln/jack) for a full featured mock/stub/spy assertion library for use with chai.

This library is primarily meant to serve as a starting point for anyone interested in developing chai plugins. If
developing a module, you are welcome to use this as a starting point. I also encourage the use of the compile
tools to allow modules to work both in node.js and the browser.

## Installation

#### Node.js

Chai spies are available on npm.

      $ npm install chai-spies

#### Browser

Include `chai-spies.js` after including `chai.js`.

```xml
<script src="chai-spies.js"></script>
```

## Plug In

If you are using `chai-spies` in the browser, there is nothing you need to do. It will detect `chai` in the global
namespace and automatically get used.

If you are using node, here is a useful bit.

```js
var chai = require('chai')
  , spies = require('chai-spies');

chai.use(spies);

var should = chai.should()
  , expect = chai.expect;
```

## Building for the Browser

Currently this package uses [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) to bundle source code. Just use `npm run build` to build browser version.

## Chai Spies Api Reference

### Creating Spies

In this module, a spy is either an empty function, or a wrapped named function.
Once chai has been extended, you can create a spy through chai's own interface.

```js
function original () {
  // do something cool
}

var spy = chai.spy(original);

// then use in place of original
ee.on('some event', spy);

// or use without original
var spy_again = chai.spy();
ee.on('some other event', spy_again);

// or you can track an object's method
var array = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
chai.spy.on(array, 'push');

// or you can track multiple object's methods
chai.spy.on(array, 'push', 'pop');

array.push(5);

// and you can reset the object calls
array.push.reset();

// or you can create spy object
var object = chai.spy.object([ 'push', 'pop' ]);
object.push(5);

// or you create spy which returns static value
var spy = chai.spy.returns(true);

spy(); // true
```

### Assertions

#### .spy

Asserts that object is a spy.

```js
expect(spy).to.be.spy;
spy.should.be.spy;
```

#### .called

Assert that a spy has been called. Negation passes through.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called();
spy.should.have.been.called();
```

Note that `called` can be used as a chainable method.

#### .with

Assert that a spy has been called with a given argument at least once,
even if more arguments were provided.

```js
spy('foo');
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.with('foo');
spy.should.have.been.called.with('foo');
```

Will also pass for `spy('foo', 'bar')` and `spy(); spy('foo')`.

If used with multiple arguments, assert that a spy has been called
with all the given arguments at least once.

```js
spy('foo', 'bar', 1);
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.with('bar', 'foo');
spy.should.have.been.called.with('bar', 'foo');
```

#### .with.exactly

Similar to .with, but will pass only if the list of arguments is
exactly the same as the one provided.

```js
spy();
spy('foo', 'bar');
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.with.exactly('foo', 'bar');
spy.should.have.been.called.with.exactly('foo', 'bar');
```

Will not pass for `spy('foo')`, `spy('bar')`, `spy('bar');
spy('foo')`, `spy('foo'); spy('bar')`, `spy('bar', 'foo')` or
`spy('foo', 'bar', 1)`.

Can be used for calls with a single argument too.

#### .always.with

Assert that every time the spy has been called the argument list
contained the given arguments.

```js
spy('foo');
spy('foo', 'bar');
spy(1, 2, 'foo');
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.always.with('foo');
spy.should.have.been.called.always.with('foo');
```

#### .always.with.exactly

Assert that the spy has never been called with a different list of
arguments than the one provided.

```js
spy('foo');
spy('foo');
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.always.with.exactly('foo');
spy.should.have.been.called.always.with.exactly('foo');
```

#### .once

Assert that a spy has been called exactly once.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.once;
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.once;
spy.should.have.been.called.once;
spy.should.not.have.been.called.once;
```

#### .twice

Assert that a spy has been called exactly twice.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.twice;
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.twice;
spy.should.have.been.called.twice;
spy.should.not.have.been.called.twice;
```

#### .exactly(n)

Assert that a spy has been called exactly `n` times.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.exactly(3);
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.exactly(3);
spy.should.have.been.called.exactly(3);
spy.should.not.have.been.called.exactly(3);
```

#### .min(n) / .at.least(n)

Assert that a spy has been called minimum of `n` times.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.min(3);
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.at.least(3);
spy.should.have.been.called.at.least(3);
spy.should.not.have.been.called.min(3);
```

#### .max(n) / .at.most(n)

Assert that a spy has been called maximum of `n` times.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.max(3);
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.at.most(3);
spy.should.have.been.called.at.most(3);
spy.should.not.have.been.called.max(3);
```
#### .above(n) / .gt(n)

Assert that a spy has been called more than `n` times.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.above(3);
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.gt(3);
spy.should.have.been.called.gt(3);
spy.should.not.have.been.called.above(3);
```

#### .below(n) / .lt(n)

Assert that a spy has been called fewer than `n` times.

```js
expect(spy).to.have.been.called.below(3);
expect(spy).to.not.have.been.called.lt(3);
spy.should.have.been.called.lt(3);
spy.should.not.have.been.called.below(3);
```

## Tests

Tests are written using [mocha](http://github.com/visionmedia/mocha) in the BDD interface.
Node tests can be executed using `npm test`. Browser tests can be seen by opening `test/browser/index.html`.
